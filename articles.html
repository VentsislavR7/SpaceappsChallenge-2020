                The toll of Covid-19 has impacted all of us, profoundly.  For people of color, that impact has been disproportionate and overwhelming.
                In recent weeks, we’ve seen the killings of George Floyd, after buying cigarettes at a deli in Minneapolis; of Ahmaud Arbery, jogging in 
                Glynn County, Georgia; and of Breonna Taylor, an EMT sleeping in her home in Louisville, Kentucky. Their deaths have led to global
                protests and highlighted the systemic racism...

                The United States is in crisis. As we write this article, videos of racial violence and racist threats toward Black people in America
                flood social and news media channels. Public demonstrations against injustice are happening in at least 30 localities.
                 During non-violent protests, other parties have engaged in vandalism and looting, spurring varied and often disproportionate
                  police response.

                When I was studying at Oberlin College, a fellow student once compared me to her dog. Because my name is Simba, a name Americans associate
                with animals, she unhelpfully shared that her dog’s name was also Simba. She froze with embarrassment, realizing that her remark could
                 be perceived as debasing and culturally insensitive.It’s a good example of what social-justice activists term microaggressions—behaviors

                  I don’t know about you, but I’m finding it very easy to be judgmental these days. Late last week, a coworker told me on Slack that she was going
               to be offline for a bit while she greeted her babysitter, who was showing up any minute. My immediate thought was, “That’s not social distancing.”
                For a split second I was mad at her. How could she let another person into her house at this time? Why isn’t she doing her part to flatten the
                 curve? My feelings soon morphed into guilt and then into sadness and grief. I didn’t want to be annoyed with my coworker. So why was I?

                        When a video goes viral showing violence against a black person, the shock waves are felt throughout our community. Our social feeds show a
                         mixture of outrage, despair and an overall sense of fatigue.When another breaking news story inevitably takes center stage and pushes
                          the violence into the background, we still feel that pain. Black people don’t have the luxury of moving on when the media does.
